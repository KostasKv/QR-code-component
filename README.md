## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS

### What I learned

- How to quickly deploy a site using Netlify
- Centering a div vertically by using a flexbox as a wrapper

### Continued development

Going forward, I want to:

- Work more on understanding positioning in CSS (e.g., different ways to centre a div).
- Reconstruct this component using Tailwind CSS

### Useful resources

- [Tailwind CSS box shadow utilities](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/box-shadow) - Even though this solution does not use Tailwind CSS, their document page for box shadows helped me to save time and implement a decent looking one very quickly.
- [Centre a Div Vertically Using CSS](https://www.delftstack.com/howto/css/center-a-div-vertically/#use-the-css-flexbox-to-vertically-center-the-div-in-css) - Short easy-to-read example code showing a quick trick to centre content vertically on the page (by wrapping it all in a flexbox).
